### Purpose

The scripts hosted here are for processing Ultrasound Tongue Imaging data.

### The scripts

`plotTracesAvg.py` - This script takes trace data and does two things (with adjusting of some variables): 1. plots averaged traces Â±standard deviation bands by category, and 2. determines the areas of greatest differentiation and complete overlap of tongue position for the two categories.
